		<p>Here is my personal website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>I was born and raised up in China, and I obtained my master degree in electrical engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. Then I started my Ph.D. research at <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en"> imec </a> in Belgium, 
			and earned my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KULeuven</a> in 2021. </p>

		My professional work and attention are focused on developing preventative mHealth and self-care solutions via passive monitoring of daily behaviors.<br><br>
		
		The mission is to digitize lifestyle and behavior by providing intelligent solutions for sensing, capturing, and analyzing traces and states of being, so that people can connect dots, extract meaning, get actionable insights, and initiate positive change.

		<p>I am mostly interested in these topics:
