			<p>my Ph.D. projects while @ <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en"> imec </a>. </p>
			
			<p>My projects at imec were focused on developing preventative mHealth and self-care solutions via passive monitoring of health behaviors.
			Firstly, I engineered a non-invasive monitoring system to monitor the moment-to-moment biopsychosocialenvironmental context of each user. The system was comprised of three wearable sensors, a cloud database, a website and a mobile phone app. <br>
			Secondly, by fusing these data collected from all the sensors, we build up a model that was able to understand and adapt to user's phenotype and varying context.<br>
			Finally, we could give dynamically personalized and temporally-precise suggestion/interventions to each individual, so that we can nudge people with unhealthy lifestyle to be healthy and stay healthy.</p>

		<p>I am mostly interested in these topics: <em>quantified-self, preventitative healthcare, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics</em> <br/><br/>
		
		This website is still under progress
