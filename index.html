				<p>My professional work and attention are focused on developing preventative mHealth and self-care solutions via passive monitoring of daily behaviors.<br><br>
				
				The mission is to digitize lifestyle and behavior by providing intelligent solutions for sensing, capturing, and analyzing traces and states of being, so that people can connect dots, extract meaning, get actionable insights, and initiate positive change.
