Well. Finally I got around to putting up my first website on GitHub. Hope everything will work. My figures are crossed. 

By following the instructions from [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) who have written wonderful tutorial to guide beginners through the hazardous process, I was able to set up my first website on GitHub based on Jekyll and GitHub Page. 

It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
 
 
##### This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I can use Markdown to author my posts.
