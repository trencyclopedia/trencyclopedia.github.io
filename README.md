## Brief introduction
Here is my personal website project. Based on GitHub pages, I build up my first website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. I would very much like to broaden my horizen and sharpen my skills in the digital world. 

Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.

## Techniques
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

This website is set up based on Jekyll and GitHub pages techniques which can automatically convert markdown files into html files and then host these files on the github useraccount domain. Awesome!!

Actually this README file has been wrintten under Markdown syntax which is just another markup language like html but is more human-readable. Awesome!

## Other resources:
### this website is setup by following the instruction from [Jonathaan](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
