		<p>Here is my personal website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>I was born and raised up in China, and I obtained my master degree in electrical engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. Then I started my Ph.D. research at <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en"> imec </a> in Belgium, 
			and earned my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KULeuven</a> in 2021. </p>

		<p>My Ph.D. topic was focused on developing preventative mhealth and self-care solutions via passive monitoring of health behaviors.
		Firstly, I engineered a non-invasive monitoring system to monitor the moment-to-moment biopsychosocialenvironmental context of each user. The system was comprised of three wearable sensors, a cloud database, a website and a mobile phone app. 
		Secondly, by fusing these data collected from all the sensors, we build up a model that was able to understand and adapt to user's phenotype and varying context.
		Finally, we could give dynamically personalized and temporally-precise suggestion/interventions to each individual, so that we can nudge people with unhealthy lifestyle to be healthy and stay healthy.
		</p>

		<p>I am mostly interested in these topics: <em>quantified-self, preventitative healthcare, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics</em>
