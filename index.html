        <h1>Hi there, I'm Ericï¼Œ Welcome to my virtual world!</h1>
       
	<p>Here is my personal website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>I was born and raised up in China, and I obtained my master degree in electrical engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. Then I started my Ph.D. research at <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en"> imec </a>, Belgium in 2015, 
		and earned my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KULeuven</a> in 2021. My Ph.D. topic was focused on developing preventative mhealth and self-care solutions via passive monitoring of health behaviors for the people.My Ph.D. topic was about developing preventative mhealth and self-care solutions for the people. 
	In order to do that, first we need a way to moniter perople's healhth status through ubiquitous sensors. These sesors could measure both physiological and contextual data.
	Second, by fusing these data collected from all the sensors, we build up a model that is able to understand and adapt to user's phenotype.
	Finally, we can give precise and tailored suggestion/medicine to the users, so that we can nudge people with unhealthy lifestyle to be healthy and stay healthy.
	</p>
	<p>I am interested in these topics: <em>preventitative healthcare, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis</em>
