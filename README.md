## Brief introduction
Here is my personal website project. Based on GitHub pages, I build up my first website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. I would very much like to broaden my horizen and sharpen my skills in the digital world. 

Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.

## Techniques
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

This website is set up based on Jekyll and GitHub pages techniques which can automatically convert markdown files into html files and then host these files on the github useraccount domain. Awesome!!

Actually this README file has been wrintten under Markdown syntax which is just another markup language like html but is more human-readable. Awesome! But it's sitll possible to write in html language, for example the next paragraph is written in html syntax.

## Next step
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://yeswejekyll.com/#_includes">Create <code>_includes</code></a>. They're a lot like <code>_layouts</code>, only smaller snippets of markup and can be injected into your <code>_layouts</code> and pages.
		<ul><li>Try creating an <code>_include</code> file that inserts Google Analytics tracking code into your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> so you can get stats on the visitors to your website. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_includes/analytics.html">example</a>.</li>
			<li>Want commenting for your blog? Create a <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_includes/disqus.html">DISQUS <code>_include</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/post.html">call it in your <code>post.html</code> layout</a>.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Don't want github.io in your URL? <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">Set up a custom domain</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/">Add blogging pagination</a></li>
	<li>Create a <code>sitemap.xml</code> file for better SEO. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages">You can have one automatically generated by GitHub Pages</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/sitemap.xml">this one</a> I use for my site.</li>
	<li>Become a coding pro and create a <code>development</code> branch of your site. Each time you want to fix a bug or add a new feature you can create a copy of your master branch, make your changes, and then merge that branch to the master branch. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/branching-out">The idea is to keep the master branch clean</a>.</li>
	<li>Need more inspiration? Check out how <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/sites/">the sites from the developers of Jekyll</a> are setup or browse this <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">huge list of sites using Jekyll</a>.</li>
</ul>
