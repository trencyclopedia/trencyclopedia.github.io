        <h1>Hi there, I'm Eric in the virtual world!</h1>
       
	<p>Here is my personal website hosting topics and projects that facinate me. Looking forward to discussing and sharing with people of similar interest.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>My Phd topic is about developing preventative healcare solutions for the people. 
	In order to do that, first we need a way to moniter perople's healhth status through ubiquitous sensors. These sesors could measure both physiological and contextual data.
	Second, by fusing these data collected from all the sensors, we build up a model that is able to understand and adapt to user's phenotype.
	Finally, we can give precise and tailored suggestion/medicine to the users, so that we can nudge people with unhealthy lifestyle to be healthy and stay healthy.
	</p>
	<p>I am interested in these topics: <em>preventitative healthcare, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis</em> 
        <br>
	What about you? <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a>

	This website is still under progress
